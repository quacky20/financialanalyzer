"We continue to look for ways to incent growth and improve restaurant margins. Beginning in 2024, we will increase the",,,,,,,,
fixed operating margin that our,,Domestic,"commissaries charge. At the same time, we are offering new opportunities for our",,,,,

We,have also been a leader in the use of third-party,domestic delivery,,,,,,

Our,,Domestic,,Company-owned restaurant growth strategy is to continue to open restaurants in existing markets as,,,,
"appropriate, t",,,"hereby increasing consumer awareness, increasing market share, improving customer service and enabling us",,,,,
to take advantage of operational and marketing scale efficiencies. We have co-developed Domestic markets with some,,,,,,,,
"franchisees or divided markets among franchisees and will continue to use market co-development in the future, where",,,,,,,,
appropriate. Our Domestic Company-owned markets are comprised of strong performing restaurants and make them,,,,,,,,
attractive locations either as Company-owned or franchised.,,,,,,,,
Our experience in developing markets indicates that market penetration through the opening of multiple restaurants in a,,,,,,,,
particular region results in increased average restaurant sales over time. We will establish a development or a master,,,,,,,,
franchise agreement with a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time,,,,,,,,
"and specified geographic area. Similarly to our Domestic Company-owned restaurant growth strategy, our International",,,,,,,,
"strategy has shown to build higher consumer awareness, increased market share, and improved operational efficiencies.",,,,,,,,
In,"the second and third quarters of 2023, we acquired",,118,formerly-franchised restaurants in the UK as Company-owned,,,,
restaurants. We recently announced International Transformation initiatives intended to enhance the profitability and cash,,,,,,,,
flow of our UK portfolio and ensure alignment of the region and its performance with our long-term strategy.,,,,,,,,See “Recent

Papa John’s is subject to income taxes in th,e United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is,,,,,,,
required in determining Papa John’s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for,,,,,,,,
"income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable and those deferred. Deferred tax assets and",,,,,,,,
liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are,,,,,,,,
measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax,,,,,,,,
"assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax attribute carryforwards (e.g., net operating losses, capital",,,,,,,,
"losses, and foreign tax credits). The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the",,,,,,,,
new tax rate is enacted.,,,,,,,,
Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts,,,,,,,,
we expect to realize and were,$37.6 million and $32.1 million,as of,"December 31, 2023",and,"December 25, 2022",",",,
respectively. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is based on the evaluation of historical,,,,,,,,
"profitability, future market growth, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary",,,,,,,,
differences and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses deferred taxes and the adequacy or need for a valuation,,,,,,,,
allowance on a quarterly basis.,,,,,,,,
